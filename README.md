 # Waze User Churn Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to address user churn for the Waze app by developing a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of users discontinuing app use. By analyzing user behavior data, this project offers insights and actionable strategies to help Waze improve user retention and target high-risk users effectively.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to build a predictive model to identify users at risk of churn. The model analyzes user behavior metrics such as session frequency and kilometers driven, providing valuable insights to enhance retention strategies.

## Key Results
- **Model Performance**: Achieved an **87% accuracy** score using the XGBoost algorithm.
- **Key Insights**: The analysis showed that users with high session frequency and substantial kilometers driven were at a higher risk of churning.
  
## Impact
This project led to several actionable recommendations for Waze:
- **Retention Strategies**: By identifying key indicators of churn, Waze can focus on targeting high-risk users (e.g., long-distance drivers) with personalized strategies to retain them.
- **Potential Reduction in Churn**: Targeted retention efforts based on these findings could help reduce churn rates by focusing on users with specific behavioral patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Analysis: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
  - Machine Learning: `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`
  - Data Visualization: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/waze-user-churn-prediction.git
   cd waze-user-churn-prediction

2. **Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed**:

3. **Run the Model: Follow the instructions in the notebook, train the model, and evaluate performance.**

## Usage and Examples

The model predicts a user's churn probability based on their usage patterns.
